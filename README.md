# stage-directr
Stage Directr is the work from my final year BEng project - "A System for Mood-based Control of Stage Lighting Effects" Although not currently mood-based, and a bit temperamental in places, it controls stage lighting through a DMX controller using spectral data from a JUCE based audio plugin.  Currently in two separate parts: an audio plugin, and a lighting control client.
