Author: James Woodbridge

Stage Directr is the work from my final year BEng project - "A System for Mood-based Control of Stage Lighting Effects" Although not currently mood-based in a true, machine learning sense, and a bit temperamental in places, it controls stage lighting through a DMX controller using spectral data from a JUCE based audio plugin and served as a proof of concept that stage lighting can be controlled in real time using spectralk features.  Currently in two separate parts: an audio plugin, and a lighting control client.
